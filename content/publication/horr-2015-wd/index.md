abstract: "A commonly observed phenomenon to elucidate distortions of perceived duration\
  \ is the filled-duration illusion: a temporal interval delimited by two marker signals\
  \ is perceived to be shorter than the same interval with several identical filler\
  \ signals. Previous investigations have focused on regularly spaced (isochronous)\
  \ fillers and the influence of their temporal structure has not been considered.\
  \ We find that intervals with isochronous fillers are perceived to last longer than\
  \ their anisochronous counterparts. The illusion increases with the amount of deviation\
  \ from isochrony and with the number of fillers. Findings also indicate that perceived\
  \ duration is specifically affected by temporal irregularities, as randomization\
  \ of the fillers' sound amplitude or frequency does not cause an appreciable distortion.\
  \ These results can be accounted for by both pacemaker-accumulator models and entrainment\
  \ models."
