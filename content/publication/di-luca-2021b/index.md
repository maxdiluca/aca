abstract: A haptic device including an active element and a plurality of passive elements coupled to the active element. Each passive element has a respective response to a wave transmitted by the active element, and is configured to cause a respective haptic effect at a respective location away from the active element. In some embodiments, the respective response includes resonating when energy having a resonant frequency is received. In some embodiments, the wave transmitted by the active element is in the form of a vibration or acoustic energy.
