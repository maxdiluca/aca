abstract: "How do we know where environmental objects are located with respect to\
  \ our body? How are we are able to navigate, manipulate, and interact with the environment?\
  \ In this chapter, we describe how capturing sensory signals from the environment\
  \ and performing internal computations achieve such goals. The first step, called\
  \ early or low-level processing, is based on the functioning of feature detectors\
  \ that respond selectively to elementary patterns of stimulation. Separate organs\
  \ capture sensory signals and then process them separately in what we normally refer\
  \ to as senses: smell, taste, touch, audition, and vision. In the first section\
  \ of this chapter, we present the sense modalities that provide sensory information\
  \ for the perception of spatial properties such as distance, direction, and extent.\
  \ Although it is hard to distinguish where early processing ends and high-level\
  \ perception begins, the rest of the chapter focuses on the intermediate level of\
  \ processing, which is implicitly assumed to be the a key component of several perceptual\
  \ and computational theories (Gibson, 1979; Marr, 1982) and for the visual modality\
  \ has been termed mid-level vision (see Nakayama, He, & Shimojo, 1995). In particular,\
  \ we discuss the ability of the perceptual system to specify the position and orientation\
  \ of environmental objects relative to other objects and especially relative to\
  \ the observer's body. We present computational theories and relevant scientific\
  \ results on individual sense modalities and on the integration of sensory information\
  \ within and across the sensory modalities. Finally, in the last section of this\
  \ chapter, we describe how the information processing approach has enabled a better\
  \ understanding of the perceptual processes in relation to two specific high-level\
  \ perceptual functions: self-orientation perception and object recognition. (PsycInfo\
