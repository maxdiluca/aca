abstract: attribute values correlates with expert similarity assessments (a method
  that does not scale). Our analysis also highlights an inher- ent trade-off between
  simulation sickness and accessibility across LTs. As such, Locomotion Vault shows
  to be a tool that unifies information on LTs and enables their standardization and
  large- scale comparison to help understand the space of possibilities in VR locomotion.
