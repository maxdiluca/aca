abstract: A haptic device including a magnet, a rigid and conductive material arranged with respect to the magnet so as to create a gap between the magnet and the rigid and conductive material is disclosed. The haptic device is configured such that a magnetic field is generated in the gap by the magnet. The haptic device also includes a plurality of coils each connected to a respective one of a plurality of protruding elements where each of the plurality of coils are configured to be positioned within the gap. Each of the plurality of protruding elements are configured to produce a respective contact with an object when the respective coil is energized. In some embodiments, the object is a hand of a user.
