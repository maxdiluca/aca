@patent{diluca2021c,
	abstract = {A method of creating localized haptic stimulations on a user includes a wearable device including a plurality of transducers that can each generate one or more waves that propagate away from the wearable device through a medium. The method includes activating two or more transducers of the plurality of transducers, selecting values for characteristics of waves to be generated by the two or more transducers based at least in part on a known impedance of the medium. The method further includes generating, by the two or more transducers, waves that constructively interfere at a target location to create a haptic stimulation on a user of the wearable device, the waves having the selected values.},

	keywords = {A haptic device including a magnet, a rigid and conductive material arranged with respect to the magnet so as to create a gap between the magnet and the rigid and conductive material is disclosed. The haptic device is configured such that a magnetic field is generated in the gap by the magnet. The haptic device also includes a plurality of coils each connected to a respective one of a plurality of protruding elements where each of the plurality of coils are configured to be positioned within the gap. Each of the plurality of protruding elements are configured to produce a respective contact with an object when the respective coil is energized. In some embodiments, the object is a hand of a user.},
