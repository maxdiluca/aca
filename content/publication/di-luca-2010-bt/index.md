abstract: "A virtual reality (VR) system tracks one or more objects to generate the\
  \ depiction of a virtual environment from the user's vantage point. No system achieves\
  \ this instantaneously: changes in the depicted virtual environment are delayed\
  \ from changes in the position of the objects being tracked. In this paper, a method\
  \ is proposed to quantify this time difference, the end-to-end delay of the VR system.\
  \ Two light-sensing devices and two luminance gradients are used to simultaneously\
  \ encode the position of one tracked object and its virtual counterpart. One light-sensing\
  \ device is attached to the tracked object and it captures light from the gradient\
  \ in the physical environment. The other device captures light from the gradient\
  \ in the virtual environment. A measurement is obtained by moving the tracked object\
  \ repetitively (by hand) across the gradient. The end-to-end delay is the asynchrony\
  \ between the signals generated by the two light-sensing devices. The results collected\
  \ with oscillatory movements performed at different frequencies indicate that for\
  \ some VR systems, the end-to-end delay might not be constant but could vary as\
  \ a function of the oscillation frequency."
