abstract: The environment has a temporal structure, and knowing when a stimulus will
  appear translates into increased perceptual performance. Here we investigated how
  the human brain exploits temporal regularity in stimulus sequences for perception.
  We find that the timing of stimuli that occasionally deviate from a regularly paced
  sequence is perceptually distorted. Stimuli presented earlier than expected are
  perceptually delayed, whereas stimuli presented on time and later than expected
  are perceptually accelerated. This result suggests that the brain regularizes slightly
  deviant stimuli with an asymmetry that leads to the perceptual acceleration of expected
  stimuli. We present a Bayesian model for the combination of dynamically-updated
  expectations, in the form of a priori probability of encountering future stimuli,
  with incoming sensory information. The asymmetries in the results are accounted
  for by the asymmetries in the distributions involved in the computational process.
