abstract: Handling a compliant object using a pinch grasp provides sensory information
  about deformation and resistive force from both index finger and thumb. In this
  paper, an object with rigid surfaces and composed of two compliant materials fixed
  on a central position is used to address how information from the two fingers is
  integrated into a holistic percept of compliance. Results indicate that with small
  differences in material compliance there is a small tendency to rely more on the
  information at the index finger. With larger differences in material compliance
  participants adopt different movement patterns with the two fingers to explore the
  objects. Compliance judgments depend on the relative amount of motion and force
  exerted-the finger that presses more contributes more to the final estimate. This
  tendency is consistent with the utilization of a unique force signal for the two
  fingers. The uneven contribution of the sensory information in the pinch leads to
  predictable compliance discrimination performance from the performance obtained
  using the fingers independently. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
