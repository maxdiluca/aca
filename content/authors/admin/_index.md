bio: Dr Di Luca is Senior Lecturer at the University of Birmingham in the Centre for Computational Neuroscience and Cognitive
  research centre. 
  
  He earned the Laurea in Psychology from the Università
  di Trieste in 2000 and the PhD in Cognitive Science from Brown University in
  2006. During his carer, Dr Di~Luca has been Scientist at the Max Planck
  Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Tübingen, Visiting Scientist at Oculus
  Research and Research Scientist at Facebook Reality Labs.
  
  Dr Di Luca performs both fundamental and applied research to investigate how humans process multisensory stimuli, with an accent on understanding the temporal, dynamic, and interactive nature of perception. He uses psychophysical experiments and neuroimaging methods to capture how the brain employs multiple sources of sensory information and combines them with assumptions about the environment, predictions about future states of the world, and information obtained through active exploration and manipulation. Dr Di Luca employs signal processing and machine learning to discover patterns in the interaction and user's movements that relate to perception. The leitmotiv of his research is to create computational models that constitute quantitative and testable theories about the underlying cognitive and neural processes. Such models can be used for simulations (i.e. to be implemented in robots), rendering (i.e. in haptic devices), and prediction about the user movement, responses, states (i.e. to optimise the generation of sensory cues in VR system by using perceptual metrics).

Dr Di Luca is Senior Lecturer at the University of Birmingham in the CNCR research centre. Using psychophysical methods and computational models, he investigates how the human brain processes multisensory information for perception and action.


He earned the Laurea in Psychology from the Università di Trieste in 2000 and the PhD in Cognitive Science from Brown University in 2006. During his carer, Dr Di Luca has been Scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Tübingen, Visiting Scientist at Oculus Research and Research Scientist at Facebook Reality Labs.
