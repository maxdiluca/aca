abstract: What is the apparent softness of a grasped object composed of two compliant
  materials? Experimental data indicates that perceived softness of a composite object
  depends on how the object is grasped and how it is oriented. If the object is grasped
  with a precision grip using index and thumb, turning around the object leads to
  a consistent change in overall perceived softness. Namely, the composite object
  seems softer when the index is in contact with the more compliant material than
  when it is in contact with the stiffer material. Importantly, such a difference
  in perceived softness due to object orientation is not present when the precision
  grip is obtained by opposing index and middle fingers to the thumb.
