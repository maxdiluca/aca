abstract: The ability to discriminate temporal intervals in the milliseconds-to-seconds
  range has been accounted for by proposing that duration is encoded in the dynamic
  change of a neuronal network state. A critical limitation of such networks is that
  their activity cannot immediately return to the initial state, a restriction that
  could hinder the processing of intervals presented in rapid succession. Empirical
  evidence in the literature consistently shows impaired duration discrimination performance
  for 100 ms intervals demarked by short auditory stimuli immediately preceded by
  a similar interval. Here we tested whether a similar interference is present with
  longer intervals (300 ms) demarked either by auditory or by visual stimuli. Our
  results show that while temporal estimates of auditory stimuli in this range are
  not affected by the interval between them, duration discrimination with this duration
  is significantly impaired with visual intervals presented in rapid succession. The
  difference in performance between modalities is overall consistent with state-dependent
  temporal computations, as it suggests that the limits due to slow neuronal dynamics
  greatly depends on the sensory modality with which the intervals are demarked, in
  line with the idea of intrinsic, modality-specific neural mechanisms for interval
  timing.
