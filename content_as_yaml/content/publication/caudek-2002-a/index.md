abstract: Observers' perceptions of the three-dimensional structure of smoothly curved
  surfaces defined by patterns of image shading were investigated under varying conditions
  of illumination. In five experiments, observers judged the global orientation and
  the motion of the simulated surfaces from both static and dynamic patterns of image
  shading. We found that perceptual performance was more accurate with static than
  with dynamic displays. Dynamic displays evoked systematic biases in perceptual performance
  when the surface and the illumination source were simulated as rotating in opposite
  directions. In these conditions, the surface was incorrectly perceived as rotating
  in the same direction as the illumination source. Conversely, the orientation of
  the simulated surfaces was perceived correctly when the frames making up the apparent-motion
  sequences of the dynamic displays were presented as static images. In Experiment
  6, moreover, the results obtained with the computer-generated displays were replicated
  with solid objects.
