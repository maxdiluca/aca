abstract: An isochronous sequence is a series of repeating events with the same inter-onset-interval.
  A common finding is that as the length of a sequence increases, so does temporal
  sensitivity to irregularities - that is, the detection of deviations from isochrony
  is better with a longer sequence. Several theoretical accounts exist in the literature
  as to how the brain processes sequences for the detection of irregularities, yet
  there remains to be a systematic comparison of the predictions that such accounts
  make. To compare the predictions of these accounts, we asked participants to report
  whether the last stimulus of a regularly-timed sequence appeared 'earlier' or 'later'
  than expected. Such task allowed us to separately analyse bias and performance.
  Sequences lengths (3, 4, 5 or 6 beeps) were either randomly interleaved or presented
  in separate blocks. We replicate previous findings showing that temporal sensitivity
  increases with longer sequence in the interleaved condition but not in the blocked
  condition (where performance is higher overall). Results also indicate that there
  is a consistent bias in reporting whether the last stimulus is isochronous (irrespectively
  of how many stimuli the sequence is composed of). Such result is consistent with
  a perceptual acceleration of stimuli embedded in isochronous sequences. From the
  comparison of the models' predictions we determine that the improvement in sensitivity
  is best captured by an averaging of successive estimates, but with an element that
  limits performance improvement below statistical optimality. None of the models
  considered, however, provides an exhaustive explanation for the pattern of results
  found.
