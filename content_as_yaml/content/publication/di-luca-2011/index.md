abstract: Spring compliance is perceived by combining the sensed force exerted by
  the spring with the displacement caused by the action (sensed through vision and
  proprioception). We investigated the effect of delay of visual and force information
  with respect to proprioception to understand how visual-haptic perception of compliance
  is achieved. First, we confirm an earlier result that force delay increases perceived
  compliance. Furthermore, we find that perceived compliance decreases with a delay
  in the visual information. These effects of delay on perceived compliance would
  not be present if the perceptual system would utilize all force-displacement information
  available during the interaction. Both delays generate a bias in compliance which
  is opposite in the loading and unloading phases of the interaction. To explain these
  findings, we propose that information during the loading phase of the spring displacement
  is weighted more than information obtained during unloading. We confirm this hypothesis
  by showing that sensitivity to compliance during loading movements is much higher
  than during unloading movements. Moreover, we show that visual and proprioceptive
  information about the hand position are used for compliance perception depending
  on the sensitivity to compliance. Finally, by analyzing participants' movements
  we show that these two factors (loading/unloading and reliability) account for the
  change in perceived compliance due to visual and force delays.
