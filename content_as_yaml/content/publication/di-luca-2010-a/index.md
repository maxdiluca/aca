abstract: Internal consistency of local depth, slant, and curvature judgments was
  studied by asking participants to match two 3D surfaces rendered by different mixtures
  of 3D cues (velocity, texture, and shading). We found that perceptual judgments
  were not consistent with each other, with cue-specific distortions. Adding multiple
  cues did not eliminate the inconsistencies of the judgments. These results can be
  predicted by the Intrinsic Constraint (IC) model according to which the perceptual
  metric local estimates are a monotonically increasing function of the Signal-to-Noise
  Ratio of the optimal combination of direct information of 3D shape (Domini, Caudek,
  & Tassinari, 2006). ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
