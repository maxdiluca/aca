abstract: As an alternative to thimble devices for the fingertips, we investigate
  haptic systems that apply stimulus to the user's forearm. Our aim is to provide
  effective interaction with virtual objects, despite the lack of co-location of virtual
  and real-world contacts, while taking advantage of relatively large skin area and
  ease of mounting on the forearm. We developed prototype wearable haptic devices
  that provide skin deformation in the normal and shear directions, and performed
  a user study to determine the effects of haptic feedback in different directions
  and at different locations near the wrist during virtual manipulation. Participants
  performed significantly better while discriminating stiffness values of virtual
  objects with normal forces compared to shear forces. We found no differences in
  performance or participant preferences with regard to stimulus on the dorsal, ventral,
  or both sides of the forearm.
