abstract: 'This chapter discusses the sensory systems that have been shown to contribute
  to spatial perception – vestibular, body-based, audition, and vision. We then present
  how spatial information is typically multisensory and estimates are integrated within
  and between sensory systems. Specifically, we cover how integration is modeled in
  terms of probabilistic inference by analyzing several topics: fusion and segregation,
  strategies for sensory integration, the outcome of integration, the role of prior
  knowledge, and how integration leads to recalibration. Finally, we discuss two topics
  in high-level perception that have an intrinsic multisensory nature, selforientation
  perception and object recognition.'
