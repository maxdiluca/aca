abstract: Visual delays are unavoidable in augmented reality setups and occur in different
  steps of the rendering pipeline. In the context of haptic interaction with virtual
  objects, it has been shown that delayed force feedback can alter the perception
  of object stiffness. We hypothesize that delays in augmented reality systems can
  have similar consequences. To test this, we carried out a user study to investigate
  the effect of visual and haptic delays on the perception of stiffness. The experiment
  has been performed in an optimized visuo-haptic augmented reality setup, which allows
  to artificially manipulate delays during visual and haptic rendering. In line with
  previous results, delays for haptic feedback resulted in decreased perceived stiffness.
  In contrast, visual delays caused an increase in perceived stiffness. However, the
  simultaneous occurrence of delays in both sensory channels led to a partial compensation
  of these effects. This could potentially help to correct stiffness perception of
  virtual objects in visuo-haptic augmented reality systems.
