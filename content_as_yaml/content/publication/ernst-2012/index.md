abstract: The brain receives information about the environment from all the sensory
  modalities, including vision, touch, and audition. To interact efficiently with
  the environment, this information must eventually converge to form a reliable and
  accurate multimodal percept. This process is often complicated by the existence
  of noise at every level of signal processing, which makes the sensory information
  derived from the world unreliable and inaccurate. There are several ways in which
  the nervous system may minimize the negative consequences of noise in terms of reliability
  and accuracy. Two key strategies are to combine redundant sensory estimates and
  to use prior knowledge. This chapter elaborates further on how these strategies
  may be used by the nervous system to obtain the best possible estimates from noisy
  signals.
