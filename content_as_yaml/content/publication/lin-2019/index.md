abstract: 'Most commercial virtual reality applications with self avatars provideusers
  with a ''one-size fits all'' avatar. While the height of this body may be scaled
  to the user''s height, other body proportions, such as limb length and hand size,
  are rarely customized to fit an individual user. Prior research has shown that mismatches
  between users'' avatars and their actual bodies can affect size perception and feelings
  of body ownership. In this paper, we consider how concepts related to the virtual
  hand illusion, user experience, and task efficiency are influenced by variations
  between the size of a user''s actual hand and their avatar''s hand. We also consider
  how using a tracked controller or tracked gestures affect these concepts. We conducted
  a 2Ã—3 within-subjects study (n=20), with two levels of input modality: Using tracked
  finger motion vs. a hand-held controller (Glove vs. Controller), and three levels
  of hand scaling (Small, Fit, and Large). Participants completed 2 block-assembly
  trials for each condition (for a total of 12 trials). Time, mistakes, and a user
  experience survey were recorded for each trial. Participants experienced stronger
  feelings of ownership and realism in the Glove condition. Efficiency was higher
  in the Controller condition and supported by play data of more time spent, blocks
  grabbed, and blocks dropped in the Glove condition. We did not find enough evidence
  for a change in agency and the intensity of the virtual hand illusion depending
  on hand size. Over half of the participants indicated preferring the Glove condition
  over the Controller condition, mentioning fun and efficiency as factors in their
  choices. Preferences on hand scaling were mixed but often attributed to efficiency.
  Participants liked the appearance of their virtual hand more while using the Fit
  instead of Large hands. Several interaction effects were observed between input
  modality and hand scaling, for example, for smaller hands, tracked hands evoked
  stronger feelings of ownership compared to using a controller. Our results show
  that the virtual hand illusion is stronger when participants are able to control
  a hand directly rather than with a hand-held device, and that the virtual reality
  task must first be considered to determine which modality and hand size are the
  most applicable.'
