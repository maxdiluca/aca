abstract: 'Abstract A virtual reality (VR) system tracks one or more objects to generate
  the depiction of a virtual environment from the user''s vantage point. No system
  achieves this instantaneously: changes in the depicted virtual environment are delayed
  from changes in the position of the objects being tracked. In this paper, a method
  is proposed to quantify this time difference, the end-to-end delay of the VR system.
  Two light-sensing devices and two luminance gradients are used to simultaneously
  encode the position of one tracked object and its virtual counterpart. One light-sensing
  device is attached to the tracked object and it captures light from the gradient
  in the physical environment. The other device captures light from the gradient in
  the virtual environment. A measurement is obtained by moving the tracked object
  repetitively (by hand) across the gradient. The end-to-end delay is the asynchrony
  between the signals generated by the two light-sensing devices. The results collected
  with oscillatory movements performed at different frequencies indicate that for
  some VR systems, the end-to-end delay might not be constant but could vary as a
  function of the oscillation frequency.'
