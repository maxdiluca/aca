abstract: We examined the contributions of kinesthetic and skin stretch cues to static
  weight perception. In three psychophysical experiments, several aspects of static
  weight perception were assessed by asking participants either to detect on which
  hand a weight was presented or to compare between two weight cues. Two closed-loop
  controlled haptic devices were used to present cutaneous and kinesthetic weights,
  in isolation and together, with a precision of 0.05g. Our results show that combining
  skin stretch and kinesthetic information leads to better weight detection thresholds
  than presenting uni-sensory cues does. For supra-threshold stimuli, Weber fractions
  were 22-44%. Kinesthetic information was less reliable for lighter weights, while
  both sources of information were equally reliable for weights up to 300g. Weight
  was perceived as equally heavy regardless of whether skin stretch and kinesthetic
  cues were presented together or alone. Data for lighter weights complied with an
  Optimal Integration model, while for heavier weights, measurements were closer to
  predictions from a Sensory Capture model. The presence of correlated noise might
  explain this discrepancy, since that would shift predictions from the Optimal Integration
  model towards our measurements. Our experiments provide device-independent perceptual
  measures, and can be used to inform, for instance, skin stretch device design.
