abstract: In this work, we analyzed and compared two patterns of movement according
  to a rhythmic signal (dancing vs. cyclical rhyth- mic movements) to create a more
  natural virtual dancing partner with haptic feedback. We observed linear movements
  to reduce the analy- sis complexity and highlight the critical factors that can
  be generalized to unconstrained movements. Results indicate that dancing movements
  are performed at lower frequency of oscillation than the provided sig- nal. However,
  synchronization errors are lower during dancing, indicating that dance is a more
  natural and easy way to perform the task. Finally, the amount of jerk is higher
  while dancing, indicating that dance move- ments are not inherently smoother, but
  are instead more complex than cyclical ones.
