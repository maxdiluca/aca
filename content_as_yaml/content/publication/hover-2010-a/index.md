abstract: In this article, the data-driven haptic rendering approach presented in
  our earlier work is assessed. The approach relies on recordings from real objects
  from which a data-driven model is derived that captures the haptic properties of
  the object. We conducted two studies. In the first study, the Just Noticeable Difference
  (JND) for small forces, as encountered in our set-up, was determined. JNDs were
  obtained both for active and passive user interaction. A conservative threshold
  curve was derived that was then used to guide the model generation in the second
  study. The second study examined the achievable rendering fidelity for two objects
  with different stiffnesses. Subjects directly compared data-driven virtual feedback
  with the real objects. Results indicated that it is crucial to include dynamic material
  effects to achieve haptic feedback that cannot be distinguished from real objects.
  Results also showed that the fidelity is considerably decreased for stiffer objects
  due to limits of the display hardware. © 2010 ACM.
