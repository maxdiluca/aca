abstract: 'Two joystick-based teleoperation is a common method for controlling a remote
  machine or a robot. Their use could be counter-intuitive and could require a heavy
  mental workload. The goal of this paper is to investigate whether vibrotactile prompts
  could be used to trigger dual-joystick responses quickly and intuitively, so to
  possibly employ them for training. In particular, we investigate the effects of:
  (1) stimuli delivered either on the palm or on the back of the hand, (2) with attractive
  and repulsive mappings, (3) with single and sequential stimuli. We find that 38
  participants responded quicker and more accurately when stimuli were delivered on
  the back of the hand, preferred to move towards the vibration. Sequential stimuli
  led to intermediate responses in terms of speed and accuracy.'
