abstract: In two experiments, observers were asked to judge the relative depth of
  a probe and one or two flanker dots. In Experiment 1, we found that such judgments
  were influenced by the properties of adjacent image regions, that is, by the amount
  of angular rotation of a surrounding cloud of dots. In Experiment 2, we found that
  the properties of the adjacent image regions affected the precision of the observers'
  judgments. With only the probe and the flanker dots presented in isolation, the
  precision of observers' judgments was much lower than when probe and the flanker
  dots were surrounded by a rigidly-connected cloud of dots. Conversely, a non-rigid
  rotation of the surrounding dots was detrimental to the precision of visual performance.
  These data can be accounted for by the Intrinsic Constraint model [Domini, F., Caudek,
  C., & Tassinari, H. (2006). Stereo and motion information are not independently
  processed by the visual system. Vision Research, 46, 1707-1723], which incorporates
  the mutual constraints relating disparity and motion signals. The present investigation
  does not show that the rigidity constraint affects the visual interpretation of
  motion information alone. Rather, our results show that perceptual performance is
  affected by the linear relation between disparity and velocity signals, when both
  depth-cues are present and the distal object is, in fact, rigid. Â© 2006 Elsevier
