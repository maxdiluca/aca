abstract: This work addresses the problem of planning the reach-to-grasp trajectory
  for a robotic arm and hand, when there is uncertainty in the pose of the object
  being grasped. If the object is not in its expected location, then the robot may
  still gain additional information about the object pose by making tactile or haptic
  observations if a finger or other part of the hand collides with part of the object
  during the reach-to-grasp operation. Therefore, it is desirable to plan the reach-to-grasp
  trajectory in such a way that it takes into account and exploits knowledge about
  the size and shape of the pose distribution associated with the target pose uncertainty.
  Here we propose a reach-to-grasp trajectory planning algorithm which addresses this
  exploration-action problem by trading off a smoothness constraint against likelihood
  of making haptic observations.
