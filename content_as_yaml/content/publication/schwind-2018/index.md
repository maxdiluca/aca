abstract: Hand tracking and haptics are gaining more importance as key technologies
  of virtual reality (VR) systems. For designing such systems, it is fundamental to
  understand how the appearance of the virtual hands influences user experience and
  how the human brain integrates vision and haptics. However, it is currently unknown
  whether multi-sensory integration of visual and haptic feedback can be influenced
  by the appearance of virtual hands in VR. We performed a user study in VR to gain
  insight into the effect of hand appearance on how the brain combines visual and
  haptic signals using a cue-conflict paradigm. In this paper, we show that the detection
  of surface irregularities (bumps and holes) sensed by eyes and hands is affected
  by the rendering of avatar hands. However, sensitivity changes do not correlate
  with the degree of perceived limb ownership. Qualitative feedback provides insights
  into potentially distracting cues in visual-haptic integration.
