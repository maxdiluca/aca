abstract: For the perception of haptic environmental properties such as stiffness,
  damping, or inertia, estimates of force and movement must be combined continuously
  over time. We investigate the relations between sensitivity of perceptual judgments
  about force and the time a perceptual response is given with different types of
  hand movements. Portions of response data are selected according to their response
  time and psychometric functions are fitted. In this way, we can estimate time-dependent
  JND and PSE functions. We show that the JND is different depending on which portion
  on the response time data it is based on. The JND follows the same pattern for responses
  given after 650 ms irrespective of the movement performed. Furthermore, we find
  that forces are consistently overestimated during movement.
