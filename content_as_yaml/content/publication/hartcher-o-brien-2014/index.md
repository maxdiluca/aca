abstract: Often multisensory information is integrated in a statistically optimal
  fashion where each sensory source is weighted according to its precision. This integration
  scheme isstatistically optimal because it theoretically results in unbiased perceptual
  estimates with the highest precisionpossible. There is a current lack of consensus
  about how the nervous system processes multiple sensory cues to elapsed time. In
  order to shed light upon this, we adopt a computational approach to pinpoint the
  integration strategy underlying duration estimationof audio/visual stimuli. One
  of the assumptions of our computational approach is that the multisensory signals
  redundantly specify the same stimulus property. Our results clearly show that despite
  claims to the contrary, perceived duration is the result of an optimal weighting
  process, similar to that adopted for estimates of space. That is, participants weight
  the audio and visual information to arrive at the most precise, single duration
  estimate possible. The work also disentangles how different integration strategies
  - i.e. consideringthe time of onset/offset ofsignals - might alter the final estimate.
  As such we provide the first concrete evidence of an optimal integration strategy
  in human duration estimates.
