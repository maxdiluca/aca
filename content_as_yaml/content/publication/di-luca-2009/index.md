abstract: After exposure to asynchronous sound and light stimuli, perceived audio-visual
  synchrony changes to compensate for the asynchrony. Here we investigate to what
  extent this audio-visual recalibration effect transfers to visual-tactile and audiotactile
  simultaneity perception in order to infer the mechanisms responsible for temporal
  recalibration. Results indicate that audio-visual recalibration of simultaneity
  can transfer to audio-tactile and visual-tactile stimuli depending on the way in
  which the multisensory stimuli are presented. With presentation of co-located multisensory
  stimuli, we found a change in the perceptual latency of the visual stimuli. Presenting
  auditory stimuli through headphones, on the other hand, induced a change in the
  perceptual latency of the auditory stimuli. We argue that the difference in transfer
  depends on the relative trust in the auditory and visual estimates. Interestingly,
  these findings were confirmed by showing that audio-visual recalibration influences
  simple reaction time to visual and auditory stimuli. Presenting co-located stimuli
  during asynchronous exposure induced a change in reaction time to visual stimuli,
  while with headphones the change in reaction time occurred for the auditory stimuli.
  These results indicate that the perceptual latency is altered with repeated exposure
  to asynchronous audio-visual stimuli in order to compensate (at least in part) for
  the presented asynchrony.
