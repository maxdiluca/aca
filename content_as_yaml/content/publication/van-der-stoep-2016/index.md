abstract: 'The last quarter of a century has seen a dramatic rise of interest in the
  spatial constraints on multisensory integration. However, until recently, the majority
  of this research has investigated integration in the space directly in front of
  the observer. The space around us, however, extends in three spatial dimensions
  in the front and to the rear beyond such a limited area. The question to be addressed
  in this review concerns whether multisensory integration operates according to the
  same rules throughout the whole of three-dimensional space. The results reviewed
  here not only show that the space around us seems to be divided into distinct functional
  regions, but they also suggest that multisensory interactions are modulated by the
  region of space in which stimuli happen to be presented. We highlight a number of
  key limitations with previous research in this area, including: (1) The focus on
  only a very narrow region of two-dimensional space in front of the observer; (2)
  the use of static stimuli in most research; (3) the study of observers who themselves
  have been mostly static; and (4) the study of isolated observers. All of these factors
  may change the way in which the senses interact at any given distance, as can the
  emotional state/personality of the observer. In summarizing these salient issues,
  we hope to encourage researchers to consider these factors in their own research
  in order to gain a better understanding of the spatial constraints on multisensory
  integration as they affect us in our everyday life.'
