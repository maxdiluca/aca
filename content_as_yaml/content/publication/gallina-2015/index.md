abstract: In this paper we discuss the concept of co-adaptation between a human operator
  and a machine interface and we summarize its application with emphasis on two different
  domains, teleoperation and assistive technology. The analysis of the literature
  reveals that only in a few cases the possibility of a temporal evolution of the
  co-adaptation parameters has been considered. In particular, it has been overlooked
  the role of time-related indexes that capture changes in motor and cognitive abilities
  of the human operator. We argue that for a more effective long-term co-adaptation
  process, the interface should be able to predict and adjust its parameters according
  to the evolution of human skills and performance. We thus propose a novel approach
  termed progressive co-adaptation, whereby human performance is continuously monitored
  and the system makes inferences about changes in the users' cognitive and motor
  skills. We illustrate the features of progressive co-adaptation in two possible
  applications, robotic telemanipulation and active vision for the visually impaired.
