abstract: Causality poses explicit constraints to the timing of sensory signals produced
  by events, as sound travels slower than light, making auditory stimulation to lag
  visual stimulation. Previous studies show that implied causality between unrelated
  events can change the tolerance of simultaneity judgments for audiovisual asynchronies.
  Here, we tested whether apparent causality between audiovisual events may also affect
  their perceived temporal order. To this aim, we used a disambiguated stream-bounce
  display, with stimuli either bouncing or streaming upon each other. These two possibilities
  were accompanied by a sound played around the time of contact between the objects,
  which could be perceived as causally related to the visual event according to the
  condition. Participants reported whether the visual contact occurred before or after
  the sound. Our results show that when the audiovisual stimuli are consistent with
  a causal interpretation (i.e., the bounce caused the sound), their perceived temporal
  order is systematically biased. Namely, a stimulus dynamic consistent with a causal
  relation induces a perceptual delay in the audio component, even if the sound was
  presented first. We thus conclude that causality can systematically bias the perceived
  temporal order of events, possibly due to expectations based on the dynamics of
  events in the real world.
