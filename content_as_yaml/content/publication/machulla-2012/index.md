abstract: Recent studies show that repeated exposure to an asynchrony between auditory
  and visual stimuli shifts the point of subjective simultaneity. Usually, the measurement
  stimuli used to assess this aftereffect are interleaved with short re-exposures
  to the asynchrony. In a first experiment, we show that the aftereffect declines
  during measurement in spite of the use of re-exposures. In a second experiment,
  we investigate whether the observed decline is either due to a dissipation of the
  aftereffect with the passage of time, or the result of using measurement stimuli
  with a distribution of asynchronies different from the exposure stimulus. To this
  end, we introduced a delay before measuring the aftereffects and we compared the
  magnitude of the aftereffect with and without delay. We find that the aftereffect
  does not dissipate during the delay but instead is stored until new sensory information
  in the form of measurement stimuli is presented as counterevidence (i.e., stimuli
  with an asynchrony that differs from the one used during exposure). Â© Springer-Verlag
