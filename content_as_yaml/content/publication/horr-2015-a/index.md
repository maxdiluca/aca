abstract: 'In this work we investigate how judgments of perceived duration are influenced
  by the properties of the signals that define the intervals. Participants compared
  two auditory intervals that could be any combination of the following four types:
  intervals filled with continuous tones (filled intervals), intervals filled with
  regularly-timed short tones (isochronous intervals), intervals filled with irregularly-timed
  short tones (anisochronous intervals), and intervals demarcated by two short tones
  (empty intervals). Results indicate that the type of intervals to be compared affects
  discrimination performance and induces distortions in perceived duration. In particular,
  we find that duration judgments are most precise when comparing two isochronous
  and two continuous intervals, while the comparison of two anisochronous intervals
  leads to the worst performance. Moreover, we determined that the magnitude of the
  distortions in perceived duration (an effect akin to the filled duration illusion)
  is higher for tone sequences (no matter whether isochronous or anisochronous) than
  for continuous tones. Further analysis of how duration distortions depend on the
  type of filling suggests that distortions are not only due to the perceived duration
  of the two individual intervals, but they may also be due to the comparison of two
  different filling types.'
