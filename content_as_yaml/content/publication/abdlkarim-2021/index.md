abstract: The synthesis of realistic robot grasps in a simulated environment is pivotal
  in generating datasets that support sim-to-real transfer learning. In a step toward
  achieving this goal, we propose PrendoSim, an open-source grasp generator based
  on a proxy-hand simulation that employs NVIDIA's physics engine (PhysX) and the
  recently released articulated-body objects developed by Unity (https://prendosim.github.io).
  We present the implementation details, the method used to generate grasps, the approach
  to operationally evaluate stability of the generated grasps, and examples of grasps
  obtained with two different grippers (a parallel jaw gripper and a three-finger
  hand) grasping three objects selected from the YCB dataset (hammer, screwdriver,
  and scissors).  Compared to simulators proposed in the literature, PrendoSim balances
  grasp realism and ease of use, displaying an intuitive interface and enabling the
  user to produce a large and varied dataset of stable grasps.
