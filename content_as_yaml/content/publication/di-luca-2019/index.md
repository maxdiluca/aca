abstract: The goal of this work is to establish the range of visual-haptic asynchronies
  that go unnoticed when touching an object. To perform a psychophysical study, however,
  we would need asynchronous visual-haptic stimuli, but because the contact of the
  finger with a real object inevitably creates synchronized haptic feedback, here
  we employ instead a virtual reproduction of the interaction. Participants immersed
  in a realistic Virtual Reality environment tapped on a virtual object with their
  index while viewing a fully articulated representation of their hand. Upon tapping,
  they received haptic feedback in the form of vibration at their fingertip. After
  each tap, participants judged whether they perceived the view of the contact and
  the haptic signal to be synchronous or asynchronous and they also reported which
  of the two seemed to happen first. Despite the difference between the two judgments,
  results indicate that none of the 19 participants could reliably detect the asynchrony
  if haptic feedback was presented less than 50ms after the view of the contact with
  an object. The asynchrony tolerated for haptic before visual feedback was instead
  only 15ms. These findings can be used as guidelines for haptic feedback in hand-based
  interactions in Virtual Reality.
