abstract: The visual impression of an object's surface reflectance (\"gloss\") relies
  on a range of visual cues, both monocular and binocular. Whereas previous imaging
  work has identified processing within ventral visual areas as important for monocular
  cues, little is known about cortical areas involved in processing binocular cues.
  Here, we used human functional MRI (fMRI) to test for brain areas selectively involved
  in the processing of binocular cues. We manipulated stereoscopic information to
  create four conditions that differed in their disparity structure and in the impression
  of surface gloss that they evoked. We performed multivoxel pattern analysis to find
  areas whose fMRI responses allow classes of stimuli to be distinguished based on
  their depth structure vs. material appearance. We show that higher dorsal areas
  play a role in processing binocular gloss information, in addition to known ventral
  areas involved in material processing, with ventral area lateral occipital responding
  to both object shape and surface material properties. Moreover, we tested for similarities
  between the representation of gloss from binocular cues and monocular cues. Specifically,
  we tested for transfer in the decoding performance of an algorithm trained on glossy
  vs. matte objects defined by either binocular or by monocular cues. We found transfer
  effects from monocular to binocular cues in dorsal visual area V3B/kinetic occipital
  (KO), suggesting a shared representation of the two cues in this area. These results
  indicate the involvement of mid- to high-level visual circuitry in the estimation
  of surface material properties, with V3B/KO potentially playing a role in integrating
  monocular and binocular cues.
