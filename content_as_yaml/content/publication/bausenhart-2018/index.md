abstract: Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important
  task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein
  docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program
  Glide on a set of 19 non-$α$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction
  accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring
  of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent
  MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric,
  the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from
  21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and
  scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This
  approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63%
  success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking
  was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available,
  and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results
  and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides
  of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability
  for this approach.
