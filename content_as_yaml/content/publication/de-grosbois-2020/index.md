abstract: Because the world is dynamic in nature, sensory predictions are invariably
  important to successful interaction with it. The current experiment examined the
  influence of dynamic frequency information on the associated perceptions of simple
  geometric features. Participants were presented with short durations of vibrotactile
  stimulation to their fingertip across an array of oscillating pins. A pair of frequencies
  was used to simulate simple tactile edges across the array surface. Over a relatively
  short 'shift' duration, the frequencies at which these regions vibrated often switched
  spatial locations. Participants were required to indicate which of three possible
  shapes (left edge, right edge, or none) they experienced. The results were consistent
  with a predictive model of perceptual decision making in that responses were generally
  biased by the initial rather than the final configuration. Further, performance
  accuracy was maximized at the intermediate, 500-ms shift duration for a 10-158 Hz
  frequency pairing. This indicated that performance may be enhanced when larger frequency
  differences are used in concert with shift durations consistent with natural, exploratory
  movements.
