abstract: 'A commonly observed phenomenon to elucidate distortions of perceived duration
  is the filled-duration illusion: a temporal interval delimited by two marker signals
  is perceived to be shorter than the same interval with several identical filler
  signals. Previous investigations have focused on regularly spaced (isochronous)
  fillers and the influence of their temporal structure has not been considered. We
  find that intervals with isochronous fillers are perceived to last longer than their
  anisochronous counterparts. The illusion increases with the amount of deviation
  from isochrony and with the number of fillers. Findings also indicate that perceived
  duration is specifically affected by temporal irregularities, as randomization of
  the fillers'' sound amplitude or frequency does not cause an appreciable distortion.
  These results can be accounted for by both pacemaker-accumulator models and entrainment
  models.'
